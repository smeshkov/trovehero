# Trove Hero

An attempt to build a top down adventure game. 
Inspired by set of videos by [Francesc Campoy](https://campoy.cat/) - [Flappy Gopher](https://github.com/campoy/flappy-gopher).

## Playing game

```
go get github.com/smeshkov/trovehero
```
And run the binary generated in `$GOPATH/bin`.

OR

`make run`

Use `arrows` to move arround the orange square and avoid green square, you can use `space` jump over a blue rectangle.
